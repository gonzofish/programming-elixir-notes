# My Notes on Programming Elixir

This is for storing my notes on Dave Thomas's book _Programming Elixir_.

The actual notes can be found in the [NOTES file](NOTES.md).

## In-Book Projects

In-book projects will have tags for most (if not all) major steps developing
that code. These tags are mentioned in the [NOTES file](NOTES.md).
